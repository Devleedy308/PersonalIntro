    <main>
        <p>My favorite culture that I'm not native to would maybe be Japanese culture. I've
            gotten a lot more into anime and manga these past few years and I really enjoy it 
            more than I thought I would. I've also been eating a lot more ramen, my fiancé 
            and I have been ordering ramen from different parts of the world just to try them out recently.
        </p>
        <p>The first historical figure I think I relate to would be Benjamin Franklin. I've always admired him
            for his inventions and how he was able to do so many things in his lifetime. I aim to be as creative and
            fulfilling as he was. The second historical figure I relate to I think is Mozart. I actually listen to his 
            music quite often when I'm trying to focus or digress when it comes to work.
        </p>
        <p>A meal that represents me would be spaghetti and meatballs.</p>
        <p>I feel most creative when I am relaxed in my office and the house is quiet.</p>
